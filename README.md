This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Scrollytelling is a technique used to make changes to a graphic or other ui component as a reader scrolls down a page. In this example, I use <a href="https://github.com/jsonkao/react-scrollama">Jason Kao's</a> React interface of the Scrollama library by <a href="https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama">Russell Goldenberg</a>, to alter a line graph of weather data built with D3.js as you scroll. Try it out!
